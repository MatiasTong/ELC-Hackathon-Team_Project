# ELCHackathon 2020 - CodeSharkz: EZCheck 
![EZCheck Landing Page](/team-project/public/ezcheck1.png)<br/>

EZCheck is a web app that makes life simpler for users who want to know the where and how of getting a mammogram. In the fight against breast cancer, early detection is key and getting mammograms can be a lifesaving procedure. But people often do not get checked regularly because of stress and fear, financial reasons, misinformation, or work.

This web app streamlines the patient journey in getting a mammogram through personalized resources and step-by-step recommendations. Our aim is that it will equip women from all socioeconomic backrounds, regardless of age or insurance status, with the knowledge they need to fight against breast cancer.

This project was created for the Estee Lauder Companies Hackathon in Oct 2020. The challenge was to develop a technology solution that promotes and/or enhances the fight against breast cancer. It was built by team CodeSharkz which is comprised of the following Laguardia CC TechHire/ Software Guild alumni:
