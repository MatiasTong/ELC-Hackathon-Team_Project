# ELCHackathon 2020 - CodeSharkz: EZCheck 
![EZCheck Landing Page](/team-project/public/ezcheck.png)<br/>

EZCheck is a web app that makes life simpler for users who want to know the where and how of getting a mamogram. In the fight against breast cancer, early detection is key and getting mammogram can be a lifesaving procedure. But people often do not get checked regularly because of stress and fear, financial reasons, misinformation or work.

This web app streamlines the patient journey in getting a mammogram through personalized resources and step-by-step recommendations. Our aim is that it will equip women from all socioeconomic backrounds, regardless of age or insurance status, with the knowledge they need to fight against breast cancer.

This project was created for the Estee Lauder Companies Hackathon in Oct 2020. The challenge was to develop a technology solution that promotes and/or enhances the fight against breast cancer. It was built by team CodeSharkz which is comprised of the following Laguardia CC TechHire/ Software Guild alumni:

* SEI: Shirley Sosa
* SEI: Tom Rachtawarn
* SEI: Alan Carrasco
* SEI: Jodi Pierre-Louis 
* SEI: Matias Tong

# Try it Out:
* [EZCheck](https://sharp-wiles-a65094.netlify.app)

# How we built it
We used React and Javascript and we used Adobe XD for the wireframes. We used Netlify to deploy it.

### Challenges we ran into
* Planning the app features and working on the UI/UX design (We wanted our message to be clear and user-friendly)
* Learning Gatsby/React (Planning a study structure to meet within the timeframe)
* Trying to implement the chat bot using Lex/Amplify

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to create a web app that has a questionnaire to generate results based on the user's age and insurance. We're proud to have signed up and be able to build a web app that can help more women getting checked. We understand the importance of getting checked, education is key.

### Technologies:
* React
* Javascript
* CSS (Flexbox, Grid)
* Styled Components 
* Bootstrap
* Node.js

# What's next for EzCheck
Our goal is also to make the app user friendly so users can learn about prevention and what to expect during a mammogram. In the future, we would like to personalize our app even more by using the user's location to find nearby childcare and free mammography events and book appointments. We started off with mammograms for now to start but can be expanded to the broader topic of breast cancer screening. We love to create and build especially if its for a good cause and make an impact! Thank you for the opportunity. Sincerely, The Code Sharkz :)
