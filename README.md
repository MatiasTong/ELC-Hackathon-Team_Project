# ELCHackathon 2020 - CodeSharkz: EZCheck 
![EZCheck Landing Page](/team-project/public/ezcheck3.png)<br/><br/>

EZCheck is a web app that makes life simpler for users who want to know the where and how of getting a mammogram. In the fight against breast cancer, early detection is key and getting mammograms can be a lifesaving procedure. Some factors that prevent people from getting screened include stress or fear, financial reasons, or work. This app aims to alleviate the stress associated with getting a mammogram through personalized step by step recommendations and resources. In a socially-distant world where working from home is the new normal, BarkPark is a tool that allows us to stay closer while six feet or more apart.

This project was created for the Estee Lauder Companies Hackathon in Oct 2020 by team CodeSharkz which is comprised of the following Laguardia CC TechHire/ Software Guild alumni:
