EZCheck is a web app that makes life simpler for users who want to know the where and how of getting a mammogram. In the fight against breast cancer, early detection is key and getting mammograms can be a lifesaving procedure. But some of the factors that prevent people from getting checked regularly including stress and fear, financial reasons, misinformation, and work.<br/>

This web app streamlines the patient journey through personalized resources and step-by-step recommendations. Our aim is that it will equip women from all socioeconomic backrounds with the knowledge and information to prevent and fight against breast cancer regardless of age or insurance status.

This project was created for the Estee Lauder Companies Hackathon in Oct 2020. The challenge was to develop a technology solution that promotes and/or enhances the fight against breast cancer. It was built by team CodeSharkz which is comprised of the following Laguardia CC TechHire/ Software Guild alumni:
