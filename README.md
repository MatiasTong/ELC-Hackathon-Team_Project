The challenge was to develop a technology solution that promotes and/or enhances the fight against breast cancer.

EZ Check is a web app that allows colleagues to hangout, collaborate and get stuff done. In a socially-distant world where working from home is the new normal, BarkPark is a tool that allows us to stay closer while six feet or more apart.

This project was created for the Estee Lauder Companies Hackathon in Oct 2020 by team CodeSharkz which is comprised of the following Laguardia CC TechHire/ Software Guild alumni:

SEI: Alan
SEI: Jodi
SEI: Matias
