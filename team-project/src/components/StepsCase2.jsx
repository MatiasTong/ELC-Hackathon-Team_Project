                            <h4>Understand limitations of mammograms</h4>
                            <p>
                                - Mammograms are the best breast cancer
                                screening tests we have at this time. But
                                mammograms have their limits. For example, they
                                arenâ€™t 100% accurate in showing if a woman has
                                breast cancer
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - A false-negative mammogram looks normal even
                                though breast cancer is present. Overall,
                                screening mammograms do not find about 1 in 5
                                breast cancers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A false-positive mammogram looks abnormal even
                                though no cancer is actually present. Abnormal
                                mammograms often require extra testing
                                (diagnostic mammograms, ultrasound, and
                                sometimes MRI or even a breast biopsy) to find
                                out if the change is cancer.
